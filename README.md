# Actuarial Science

## Objective
This repository contains actuarial science analyses and simulations focused on key topics such as profitability modeling, compound Poisson distributions, and statistical inference, mortality analysis, pensions & life insurance modelling. The goal is to explore and apply statistical and probabilistic methods to solve real-world actuarial problems.

## Technologies Used
R & RStudio

## Analyses Performed
- Profitability modeling for insurance portfolios
- Simulating the impact of changes in experience factors (e.g., illness probabilities)
- Statistical inference (mean, variance, mode, median, percentiles)
- Compound Poisson distribution modeling
- Calculation of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
- Fitting of 'Generalized Linear Models' (GLMs)
- Fitting copulas, use of 'Extreme Value Theory' (EVT)
- Application of 'Credibility Theory' (Bayesian Frameworks) for pricing of insurance premiums
- Visualization of distributions using histograms and density plots
- Modelling a defined benefit pension scheme

## How to Replicate
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
